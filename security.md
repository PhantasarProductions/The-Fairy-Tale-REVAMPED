# Security

When it comes to security issues that should not be discussed in the open due to them being sensitive and therefore you have information for me that should not fall into the wrong hands, I will have to be cautious, as I don't want my private channels to be spammed (an issue I've suffered a lot from).
The best way you can go is just to open an issue here with the request to contact me in private, and I will create a temporary mail address that you can use to contact me privately. Please note, I will only have that mail address for a limited time.

For anything that is not really sensitive, just use the issue tracker please.
